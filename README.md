# Automatic Conversion of Pop Music 

# into Chiptunes for 8-Bit Pixel Art

This is a Python version implementaion of the [paper](https://lemonatsu.github.io/pdf/su17icassp.pdf).

Note that this version may generate slightly different result in compare to the original version, and the processing technique in [section 2.3](https://lemonatsu.github.io/pdf/su17icassp.pdf) of paper is omitted due to that fact that it can be achieve by tuning the parameter of [pYIN](https://code.soundsoftware.ac.uk/projects/pyin) plug-in.
